This package provides both API and WEB tests functions that can help you in your validations.

WEB:

* Mapping elements by using Page Elements
* Interaction with elements by Page Objects

* Methods used in this project: GET, POST, PATCH, PUT and DELETE.
* Feel free to add your own methods or change existing ones according to what you need

* You can (and should) change the baseUrl in cypress.config.js file. You can also change by CLI by running the following code:
